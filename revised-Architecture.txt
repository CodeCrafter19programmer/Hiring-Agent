HIRING AGENT MANAGER — REVISED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE (FINAL)
Purpose:

Build an internal AI-powered hiring management system for companies.
NOT a public job board.
NOT an applicant portal.
There are no candidate accounts in the system.

1. User Roles

The system supports ONLY TWO ROLES:

1. Admin

Full system control

Create/manage recruiters

Create jobs

Manage agents, workflows, automation

View complete analytics dashboard

2. Recruiter

Create jobs

Upload candidate CVs

Trigger agents and workflows

View candidate results

View dashboard data

REMOVE THIS ROLE COMPLETELY:

Applicant / Candidate

No signup

No login

No portal

No dashboard

No profile pages

2. High-Level Modules (KEEP THESE)
A. Dashboard

A combined internal overview:

Total Jobs

Active Agents

Running Workflows

Candidates Today

Admin + Recruiter both see this (with Admin having more metrics).

B. Jobs Module

Keep these features:

REMOVE COMPLETELY — DO NOT BUILD

Candidate profile pages	Admin-only data instead
Public job board	Jobs are internal
Apply now forms	CVs come via email or Sheets
Messaging/chat between applicant and recruiter	Not part of workflow

4. System Data Flow (Clear and Simple)

1. CVs arrive externally

Recruiters upload manually

API integration imports them

2. Admin/Recruiter triggers AI workflow

Extract CV text

Match with job requirements

Generate score

3. Candidate table updates

Name

Skills

Score

Status

4. Admin views dashboard stats

Everything stays internal.
